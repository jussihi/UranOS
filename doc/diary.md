Wrote the entrypoint of the kernel in C and also a multiboot compatible bootloader in NASM assembly. This should work with GRUB. This time the bootloader code also implements memory paging, and therefore the kernel's memory space will be in the virtual address starting from 3GiB. The system is able to boot already, it has all the necessary stuff set up; GDT is initialized with very similar code to SaturnOS. It is loaded from inline assembly instead of inside the bootloader code though. It also writes one word to the VGA buffer (Blue A) to the first character so it can be confirmed that the kernel actually boots up. Next steps are implementing of IDT, then interrupts and timers so multiple tasks can be run at the same time. Also some sort of VGA "driver" would be nice, but the way I implemented it in the SaturnOS makes me just feel bad.. Got to think about the "right way" to implement it.
